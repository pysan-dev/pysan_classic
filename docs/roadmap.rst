Roadmap
==========

This page outlines pysan's planned development priorities and upcoming features.
The pysan library is currently under active development, but no regular time slots are allocated to its development.
Releases therefore won't have a strictly defined cycle (e.g. monthly), but will be made available as soon as all of the planned features are ready!


Upcoming Release
------------------

The next planned release aims to bring pysan closer to a fully-features research capable library.
To make this happen, the following points will be met;

- multisequence counterparts for each of the methods in the core module
- finish basic user guide
- finish twitter card feature for more impactful sharing
- add at least 6 examples to the gallery
- plan out next few releases

These additions and modifications will bring pysan to version 0.2, and will be pushed to the python package index making them available to all users without having to clone the github repository.
