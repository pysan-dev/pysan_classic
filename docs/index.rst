Welcome
=================================

`pysan <https://github.com/pysan-dev/pysan>`_ is a library of methods for doing `sequence analysis <https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/social-sequence-analysis/3AC786DA3C99EB8795C7271BB350CB88>`_ using Python. It's free, open source, and each method is fully documented with examples. Using `pysan <https://github.com/pysan-dev/pysan>`_ you'll be able to run powerful sequence analysis and visualisation tasks with just a few lines of code, and integrate or extend them into your other Python workflows.

You can also use the very latest version by cloning the github repository.

.. code-block::

	git clone https://github.com/pysan-dev/pysan.git




Why use pysan?
===============
Lots of events in the natural world happen in a particular order, from making a cup of tea, to getting promotions, and so on.
In science, this applies to everything from communication data, to consumer spending, and to gambling behaviour.
Analysing these events whilst preserving their sequential order requires analysis in the sequence domain.
The pysan library contains methods for visualising, comparing, and dissecting sequences, helping you develop insights into your sequences with only a few lines of code.

**Why Python?** - Python is quickly becoming *the* go-to language for data analysis across a number of research areas.
By writing a sequence analysis library in Python, analysts can take advantage of other tools written in Python, whilst writing simple and readable code.

To find out more about sequence analysis using pysan, continue reading down this page, starting with how to install the latest version from PyPI.
