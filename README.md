# **pysan**: sequence analysis in Python

**pysan** is a library of methods for sequence analysis using Python.

## What it does
- single and multisequence visualisations
- computation of sequence alphabets and ngrams
- calculations of ngram and sequence universes
- transition matrix calculations and plots
- entropy, turbulence, and complexity statistics
- routine and dissimilarity computations
- optimal matching implementations
- heirarchical clustering

## Documentation
**pysan** docs are currently hosted at [pysan.org](https://pysan.org)

## About
**pysan** was created as a hobbyist project by [Oliver Scholten](https://twitter.com/ojscholten) after reading *[Social Sequence Analysis: Methods and Applications by Benjamin Cornwell](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/social-sequence-analysis/3AC786DA3C99EB8795C7271BB350CB88)*. It was not originally meant as a state of the art scientific package, but more of a reliable workhorse for preliminary investigations and small projects - although as more features are added it's becoming increasingly powerful.
