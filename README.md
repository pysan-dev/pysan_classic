# **pysan**: social sequence analysis in Python

**pysan** is a library of methods for sequence analysis using Python.

## What it does
- sequence visualisation
- computation of sequence alphabets and ngrams
- calculations of ngram and sequence universes
- transition matrix calculations and plots
- entropy and turbulence (coming soon)

## Documentation
Documentation is currently hosted at [pysan.org](https://pysan.org)

## About
**pysan** was created as a hobbyist project by [Oliver Scholten](https://twitter.com/ojscholten) after reading *[Social Sequence Analysis: Methods and Applications by Benjamin Cornwell](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/social-sequence-analysis/3AC786DA3C99EB8795C7271BB350CB88)*. It's not meant as a state of the art scientific package, but more of a reliable workhorse for preliminary investigations and small projects.
