# PySAN: social sequence analysis in Python

PySAN is a library of methods for performing basic social sequence analysis using Python.

## What it does
- basic visualisation of a sequence
- computation of sequence alphabets and ngrams
- calculations of ngram and sequence universes
- transition matrix calculations and plots
- more coming soon

## Why PySAN
PySAN was created as a hobbyist project by [Oliver Scholten](https://twitter.com/ojscholten) after reading *Social Sequence Analysis: Methods and Applications* by *Benjamin Cornwell*. It's not meant as a state of the art scientific package, but more of a reliable workhorse for preliminary investigations and small projects.
